### 🧾 Summary of Findings  

| Learning Challenge | Evidence Summary | Impact |
|--------------------|------------------|---------|
| Rote Memorization | Dominant across all levels of schooling | ❌ Reduces critical thinking |
| Conceptual Gaps | Found in math, science, and reading comprehension | ⚠️ Weak understanding, poor transfer skills |
| Teacher Training | Insufficient exposure to experiential pedagogy | ⚠️ Major implementation barrier |
| Assessment System | Exam-focused, not application-driven | ❌ Discourages curiosity |
| Global Benchmarking | India scores below OECD average in conceptual tests | ⚠️ Requires systemic reform |

📌 **Conclusion:**  
Across **15+ credible studies**, evidence consistently shows that **Indian education remains heavily rote-oriented**, limiting creativity and conceptual clarity.  
National policies like **NEP 2020** and **CBSE’s experiential framework** acknowledge these issues and call for a **competency-based, immersive learning revolution** — an area where **Virtual Reality (VR)** and **interactive learning ecosystems** can drive measurable transformation.
